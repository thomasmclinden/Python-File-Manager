# Python File Manager Application

This is a simple Python-based file manager application that allows users to simulate file and folder management operations in a directory-like structure. The application includes operations like creating folders and files, moving, copying, sorting, and deleting files or folders. Additionally, the application has a graphical interface to display the directory tree using `tkinter`.

## Features

- **Create Files and Folders**: Add files and folders to the root directory or subdirectories.
- **Delete Files and Folders**: Delete files or entire folders from the directory structure.
- **Move Files**: Move files between folders.
- **Copy Files**: Copy files into folders with unique names if necessary.
- **Sort Files**: Sort files in a directory.
- **Display Directory**: Display the directory structure in a GUI or terminal.

## Requirements

- The latest version of Python
- `tkinter` for GUI (usually included with Python's standard library)
- `re` (Regular Expression) module (standard Python library)

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the latest version of Python installed.
3. Run the `file_manager.py` script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python file_manager.py
